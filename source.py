# ## Topic
# *What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# The problem being addressed is the difficulty in accurately predicting home prices in the real estate markets. Homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals can benefit from a reliable and accurate model that provides an estimation of home prices based on historical sales and relevant attributes.

# ## Project Question
# *What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*
# *This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# Can a machine learning model predict home prices more accurately than a human with good real estate knowledge (my mom) of the area (Loveland, OH)?

# ## What would an answer look like?
# *What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# The hypothesized answer is that the machine learning model, when trained on a comprehensive dataset of historical sales and relevant attributes, can provide more accurate predictions of home prices than a knowledgeable human, due to its ability to consider a larger number of variables and identify complex patterns in the data.

# ## Data Sources
# *What 3 data sources have you identified for this project?*
# *How are you going to relate these datasets?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# I will be scrapping Zillow

# ## Approach and Analysis
# *What is your approach to answering your project question?*
# *How will you use the identified data to answer your project question?*
# üìù <!-- Start Discussing the project here; you can add as many code cells as you need -->
# 
# 1. Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset of historical home sales in Loveland, OH, including property attributes (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, and other relevant factors).
# 
# 2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables as needed.
# 
# 3. Feature Engineering: Identify and create new features that may have predictive power, based on domain knowledge and exploratory data analysis.
# 
# 4. Model Selection: Test various machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks) and select the one that provides the best performance, based on evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
# 
# 5. Model Training: Train the selected model on the preprocessed dataset, tuning hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.
# 
# 6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset not used during training.
# 
# 7. Interpretation and Validation: Analyze the results, interpret the model's predictions, and validate the model's accuracy by comparing it with the human's predictions on a new set of properties not used during training. If the model demonstrates superior performance, the hypothesis will be supported.

# # Data Collection

# Wow, a house sold for $10.3 million and one sold for only $1,000! Something isn't right, I did some digging and it looks like Zillow had some wrong data for some "houses". I checked the $10.3 million dollar "house" and it turns out it isn't a house. For the houses on the lower end of the price spectrum, I found that either the data was wrong or the houses were complete trash (fixer-uppers if you will). To negate these issues, I've decided to filter my dataset from the prices of $100,000 to $10,000,000.
# 
# I filtered by the zip code 45140 above so this house ins't in our data frame but it is in the raw data, go ahead and check out the price ;) - https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/6091-2nd-St-Miamiville-OH-45147/2062599063_zpid/
