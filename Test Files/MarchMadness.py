# ## Topic
# *What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# Guessing a perfect bracket is nearly impossible (1 in 120.2 billion odds if you know a little something about basketball). Winners of the Bracket Challenge Game averaged around 49.8% of correctly guessed games.

# ## Project Question
# *What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*
# *This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# Could machine learning make a perfect bracket (probably not) but could it beat the 49.8% average of correctly guessed games from the top players in the pool?  

# ## What would an answer look like?
# *What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# A machine learning model can beat the average winner rate of 49.8 correctly guessed games.

# ## Data Sources
# *What 3 data sources have you identified for this project?*
# *How are you going to relate these datasets?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# KenPom - a statistical archive of stats and ratings based on certain common metrics and custom statistical metrics (very popular among coaches, bookmakers, & bettors)
# 
# Basketball Reference - another statistical archive of college basketball games and stats, has most of the common statistics you are going to find in a game
# 
# Barttorvik - statistical archive of common stats and custom stats, like KenPom but has more custom metrics
# 
# Depedending on what stats/metrics I will be able to pull from the sources, I will relate the data based on team/year (regular season). Each data source has regular season stats/metrics for each year for each team. 

# ## Approach and Analysis
# *What is your approach to answering your project question?*
# *How will you use the identified data to answer your project question?*
# üìù <!-- Start Discussing the project here; you can add as many code cells as you need -->
# 
# I will first formulate a method to determine how I will be able to include tournament data for each games/round. From there, I can start aggregating the team stats/metrics I want to test out in the data. Depending on the initial data analysis of these features, I will use some of them for the final model.

# ## This KenPom data includes post-season data. Obviously, I do the model will not have post-season stats to use when predicting an outcome. I want to see if I can create a similar dataset with barttorvik.com (I can filter to only the regular season).
