### Reflection
<!-- Edit the following section with your reflection -->

#### What went well?
I thought overall the project went well. I was happy with the data I got and the results I saw. I thought it was a solid starter end-to-end project.
#### What did not go well?
I wish I had done a better job with the feature engineering and just picking the features. There seemed like infinite possibilities so it was hard to determine what to do.
#### What did you learn?
I learned about many aspects of a machine learning project. I learned about many different models. 
#### What would you do differently next time?
I would try and spend more time on it. I would have liked to include lat/lon and location data in more of way (like neighborhoods/subdivisions).

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bash
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.
